# Tic-Tac-Toe using JavaScript
Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. In my case, instead of Human vs Human, I  designed Human vs AI using minimax algorithm(for AI player).
