# Tic-Tac-Toe using JavaScript
Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. 

There are two ways to play the game.

1). Human Vs Human

2). Human vs AI player
                                    
   Here, I have prefered Human Vs AI player using minimax algorithm(for AI player)
